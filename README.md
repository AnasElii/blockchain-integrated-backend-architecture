# Blockchain integrated backend architecture


## Overview

Blockchain integrated backend is the Hybrid backend of the NFT Marketplace decentralized application (dApp) designed to create a cost-efficient and secure marketplace for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This project integrates both centralized and decentralized backends to optimize cost without compromising security. The smart contracts used in this project are developed with a focus on cost efficiency while ensuring the security of the marketplace. Additionally, this project serves as an educational resource for anyone interested in learning about building dApps and NFT marketplaces.

## Features

- **Decentralized and Centralized Backend**
Combines the strengths of both decentralized and centralized systems to balance cost and performance.
- **Cost-Efficient Smart Contracts**
Designed to minimize gas fees and other costs associated with blockchain transactions.
- **Secure Transactions**
Emphasis on maintaining the security and integrity of the NFT store.
- **Technology Stack**
Utilizes Node.js with Express for the backend, and various databases, including MongoDB, to manage and store data efficiently.

## Technology Stack

- **Decentralized Backend (Blockchain)**
Smart contracts developed using Hardhat and OpenZeppelin, deployed on a blockchain platform
- **Centralized Backend**
Node.js, Express, GraphQl, Ethers.js, and more...
- **InterPlanetary File System**
This project leverages Pinata for storing and retrieving media on IPFS, enhancing its decentralized architecture. Additionally, itâ€™s designed to facilitate a smooth transition to a fully serverless backend. However, you have the option to modify the project to store all data on a central server instead of IPFS
- **Databases**
This project is initially designed to work seamlessly with `MongoDB` by default. However, it can easily be adapted to integrate with other centralized or decentralized database solutions

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnasElii/blockchain-integrated-backend-architecture.git
   cd blockchain-integrated-backend-architecture
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - add `MONGODB_URI` to hold the MONGODB URI
   - add the `COUNTERS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` to hold the Counters address
   - add the `NFT_MARKETPLACE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` to hold the NFT Marketplace address
   - add `PORT` with the desired port value as example `4000`. If you need another value you need to update it in the mintNFT API
   -  add `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` to hold the Alchemy API key of the project or if you are using Infura use `INFURA_API_KEY`
   - Visit `Pinata Cloud` to sign up for a new free account.
   - add the `PINATA_JWT_TOKEN` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS` fields
   - Add necessary configuration settings (database credentials, blockchain network settings, etc.).

## Usage
  
1. **Deploy Smart Contracts**
  Follow the instructions in the [`contracts/`](https://github.com/AnasElii/blockchain-integrated-backend-architecture/tree/master/contracts) directory to deploy smart contracts using Hardhat to your preferred blockchain network.
  
1. **Start the Backend Server**
   ```bash
   node ./index.js
   ```
   Ensure your PHP server is configured correctly and running.


1. **Access the Marketplace Backend**
 Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000`, and also the `http://localhost:4000/graphql` To access the NFT_MArketplace Grpahql playground.

**Note** You can update the port value from the envirment by chaging the PORT value in the `.evn` file
